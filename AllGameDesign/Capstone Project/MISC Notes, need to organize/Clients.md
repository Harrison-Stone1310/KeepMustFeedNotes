Subject: Would you like to be the client in my capstone project
Message: Hi, my name is Harrison Stone, I am in my final year of college at UW Steven's Point Applied Computing Program and I am doing a senior capstone project. I am planning to make a video game for my project but for that to be a reality I need a client who would be interested in me making my own game or making a game project for/with them. I am still in the planning stages of the project and development for the project doesn't start until January of 2026 at the latest, however the idea for the project and the client need to be ironed out within the next two months. I know you are all busy doing amazing work with the studios you are publishing for but if you have any interest in being being a client for my capstone feel free to reach out with any questions regarding the process or anything that comes to your mind.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, even if you cannot be my client for the project it means a lot to know you took the time to read my message.

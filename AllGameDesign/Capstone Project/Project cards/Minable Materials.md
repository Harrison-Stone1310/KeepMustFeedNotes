#capstoneProject 
Need a hitbox that determines when they get hit 
A signal that when scene is loaded it will check status of mined
mined 
NEED more of a visiual feed back on the breaking/hitting. Currently is "unimpressive" per my fiancé. 
Full inventory doesn't need to be made, just check that it got mined and added to the Player's inventory

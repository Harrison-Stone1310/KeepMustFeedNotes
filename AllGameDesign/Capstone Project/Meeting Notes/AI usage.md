My attempts at using AI
First I attempted to have it make code, and found the code to be too basic for what I needed. It would need to be compeltely rewritten to be expandable and reusable
Second I tried to use it for document planning, and if failed to write in a way that I found to be effective at conveying 
Third is code documentation, there is promise there. Need to make like a Key for the AI to better make the code
NotebookLM- Can upload any documetion and ask it questions on the sources. Not sure if that would work for my game, but maybe it could. 

While I don't just AI I have started using it like Wikipedia, and using it to find sources that I do trust to get information I need. It has improved the time to find sources to fix my problems.

3 takaways
1. The refactoring the game is a good story for future interviews, shows critical thinking skills
2. Tim wants to reach out to alumni to get a better foot in the door for getting a job in game development, using the advantages of the school for me
3. Getting my game publish on a platform like Itch and Steam is a major *major* part of it for game development studios, if you are wanting to be a game developer and want to be hire then studios want to see what you have done prior. Raven studios in Madison has talked to Tim about this before, that if they talk to a developer they want them to have games published

Talk about
Starting sprint
Showing what has been made
	Mineral
	Movement (bug with fall)
	Save/Load
	Scene transitions 
	Been finding out my cards are a little on the broad side, and that next time I do a game like this breaking them down alot more
	On track to get Sprint 1 complete 
Get something that is playable enough to be an alpha where would you publish your game? 
There are 21 other folks in the program, if your complete with those guys and have a game I will talk with you 
getting it is pulbish is a big step, other thing we can do. Will is transitioning. Try to find some alumen to open some doors for me. 

No longer in the game spaces but where in them-William Haddix, Jeff Nehlsen 
Kelsey Hayes- Pokémon and Xbox (other way to get foot in the door)

The refactoring of the game is a good story for an interview, shows upper level decision making with techincal skills. Like I know when a critical judgement needs to be made an apply that judgement properly.

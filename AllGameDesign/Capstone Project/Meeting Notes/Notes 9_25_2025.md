Possible early early MVP
how much work for the sprint
Best take for a sprint 1
Need to move from the back log
and what I can accomplish in those 30 hours
It is a lot of experience base with planning those 30 hours
Prof thinks I am fine (YAY)
drafting out the first 30 hours 
3,4,5 things take off
sometimes sprint 5 is a bit behind
if everything has gone well sprint 5 is cleanup and prepwork for presentation, next steps 
Documentation showing how I managed the project, showing off what I have made, and the limits of what I can do. 
Project Plan: High level timeline, detail of first level sprint, where MVP is going. 
Good to use AI from project planning document 
Good to use code already written, document where the library of code came from 
framework and libraries, 
MVP, first level with mineable materials and a resource deposit 
At the end of sprint run recognize where you are at, and plan better for sprint 2. 
Shift from being given work to organize your own to take of.

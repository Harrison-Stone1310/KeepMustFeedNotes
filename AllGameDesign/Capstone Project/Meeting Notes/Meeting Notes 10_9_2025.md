Question on getting resources 

Planning on Godot
Looking or planning to look for help building MVP, 
based on that list, the challenging stuff and ruff plan 

As an example, last time game dev call any project taht relied on the more advanced effects in physics. Foregrounded so make sure to get early start in the project 

scene transition- depending on the complexity of the game, sort it out in the game however if that is going to become an issue in development . if tackling problem in that game if it is not working in that context is completely isolate that issue, build it out separately in it own project. Demonstrate that aspect, so nothing else can get in the way and reincorporate 
Good advice for a junior developer
Start early, test it, reintegrate it 
Save/Load

MVP, one area of play to the next. Mostly a tutorial
Know got enough if you get that in front of a player and they go "I want more"
If it doesn't sound like a whole lot, that prove that make that sprint 1, that what do you know in sprint 2

MVP that is super useful to you,
With everything on track

With the confidence in sprint 2 to just rock this thing, sprint 1 just being about getting your feet under you 

Make a sprint 1
get a scene done
get a transition done
plan for sprint 2 to be more about 

overview and description of the project 
good plan of the first sprint, head line 1evel 
nice for sprint 1, whatever I consider to be most system analysis of design
give a diagram of the first scene looks like
What resources look like
Could be couple tables in xml, give me a rough sense in design what is helpful for me. Nothing more and nothing less, outline technical stack and client agreement form super super abstract for 2-5 sprints 

Your test every step of the way is once sprint 1 is done, is sprint 1 doesn't go as plan do I have to throw everything else need to be throw out than scale back, 
Airplane - waterfall
Once we get past sprint 1

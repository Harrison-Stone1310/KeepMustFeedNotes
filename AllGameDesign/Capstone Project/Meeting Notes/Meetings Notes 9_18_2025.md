#capstoneProject #meetingnotes

Me: What are my worries? Because of the time frame for SOW do you have any tips for picking game scope? I  ADD backlog so now we can add things from the backlog and show what can be added. Begin adding a backlog *NOW* 
Client thoughts: As a client I am quite ok, if I need mostly an email person, with all of that said going to insist we do some stuff where we meet in person. Ask that we think about it, that we tentatively try to use office hours to be client hours but if it turns out that. If we don't need it any give it week, then we will adjust the schedule we will adjust schedule. 
Backlog 
Rex: Multiplayer game- base builder, godot, with humble bumble aspects
Jacob: Single player- Mobile and desktop Javascript (Why?)
Garrett: Data pipeline- aspect of project into a dashboard, from forms to readability

Just planning class, sketchy and high level for sprint 2-5
About 150 hour project 
Not going to hold up graduation as long as you communicate issues and changes in scope
If we have to shift gears that is fine
Roadblock/ showstopper that needs to change how the game would work. At the end of every sprint a go/ no go decision. 
Open endedness to what to add, scope creep

Note: First thing done was review of previous work,
	Configured Max jump hieght, Max jump distance lengths (notes in [[Player Movement]])
	Was making Mineable materials working in code, with a test object. Had to get attack working too. Test flips when it breaks. Need indicator of being hit animation (like a white light)
	Mineable stays in-between loading scenes so persistent data there, however need to make it so it adds to the inventory of player and the have that be saved. Also see [[Save and Load]] note at 12/21 on loading materials 
ToDo
	Make materials add to inventory when broken
	The inventory system is going to be a rather complex system, see note from 1/2/2026 in [[Inventory]] for best approach 
	Have save keep that information
	Have file save keep it inbetween game loads

Make materials add to inventory when mined
	The inventory system is going to be a rather complex system, see note from 1/2/2026 in [[Inventory]] for best approach 
	Probably best at this point to make a material object, so the code is built from the ground up with materials in mind
	Have Save keep the information from inventory between scene loads
	Have File Save keep it inbetween game loads
Got Done
	Made the Material object and troubleshot the reason why attack wasn't always working with it (turns out the attack state wasn't implemented yet)

Introduction

## Summary

You live on the back of a giant magical golem in a symbolic relationship, the golem provides you with a livable atmosphere and you protect the golem’s heart. 

## Inspiration

So part of the inspiration is the Terraria with it’s mining and horde aspects, but another inspiration is Valheim as they have events of enemies and protecting the base is a fun aspect (against everything but trolls). The final inspiration is Paper Mario and the Thousand year old door, the Great Boggly tree section were you fight jabbi with the punies.

## Player experience

Mine into the body of your moving base, build up defenses to fight horde battles. Death of player means nothing as you are revived, but the death of the heart restarts the run. 

## Platform

This game will be released on PC, possibly on steam and definitely on itchio.

## Development software

Godot V 4

Asesprite 

Audio is tbd

## Genre

Single player, roguelite, base defense

## Target audience

Concept

## Gameplay overview

The player will be mining into the golem to get minerals for their base defenses, the longer the game goes on the better the mining equipment the player gets and the stronger bases the player can make. As the game progresses though hoards will come and raid the base to try and break your golem’s heart. The base defenses are automated but their will be enemies the player can target to decrease the time the horde fights for. Base defenses will have health ratings that relate to how long they can hold out against enemy attacks. 

  

One of the key features I want to add is that the player character is insanely strong, their presence causes weaker foes to fee and then the player is free to attack the stronger foes. This is how I can put my own twist on the formula, but a titan that mines and defends. Abilities that follow the theme of strength. 

## Theme interpretation (Symbiotic strength)

Symbiotic- The player gets stronger by feeding the living titan they are with, and the titan gets stronger the more rare materials it is able to consume from the players conquests. 

  

The two are interlocked together, in most base defense systems the base almost feels alive as you build up defenses and work with it to defend it. The major difference is that the base only gets strength from the player and doesn’t give it. The only way for the player to get stronger is to give more strength to the Keep and the Keep can only get stronger if the Player gets stronger. 

## Primary mechanic

  

Mining- The player is able to mine nodes of minerals, these minerals are used to feed the Keep, upgrade the base defenses, and improve the weapons of the player.

Base Defenses- The base has defenses that increase the ability to handle a hoard battle. They increase the difficult, which in turns allows the player to go to more mineral right environments.

Revival system- The Keep is is able to bring the player back to life if they die while on/in the Keep, and the Player is able to reignite the Keep to allow it to come back to life. 

## Secondary mechanics

 Map- The map allows the player to pick the difficult of hoard battle or pick certain materials to focus on finding.

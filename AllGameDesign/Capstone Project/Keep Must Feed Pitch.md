You live on the back of a giant magical golem in a symbiotic relationship, the golem provides you with a livable atmosphere and you feed and protect the golem’s heart.

2D idea so far, would go through a maze of tunnels looking for materials to use to keep the golem alive. At points you would defend the heart from invaders trying to kill the heart. 

Backlog idea Suggestion from Prof on keeping track of backlog https://trello.com/

Question, what should the core gameplay loop be? Currently it looks like mine resources, deposit at heart, travel deeper to find more resources? What else can we add?  What is the game? It was hoard battles, where the golem's heart needed to be protected so you would mine resources for base defenses and then you would defend it against the onslaught. Good game or bad game? 
Take from the Potion craft, different materials allow for different directions to be opened up on the Keep
Possible additions
 adding a heart craving mechanic where the heart wants specific materials
 refining materials into ones that can't be mined
 Timer mechanic where the heart needs to be fed X amount per day
 Maybe the more you feed to bigger the radius of atmosphere is, so the deeper you can go? 
 Turn based combat for bigger fights? 
 Mix of 2d and 3d?

I was walking by myself at night looking for something i dropped, and now i have an idea for one of those 10-30 minutes retro-ps1 low poly horror games

I need to learn to make games

"I was walking by myself at night looking for something I dropped" is a horrifying premise 
Because you have two choices every time you get scared
abandon the item you need
Keep searching and risk meeting what scared you

You get me

I was thinking the game would be in first person. You're holding a flashlight looking down about idk 6 inches in front of you on the ground to look for maybe your house key? But the point is that looking down makes it so you can't see far in front of or behind you and looking up to check makes it so you can't see what you're looking for

Maybe have a mechanic where looking up can sometimes make you "hallucinate" your house key on the ground

Definitely in first person
Maybe there is a hot and cold bar, that lets you know if you are looking around the correct area. Looking up resets the bar so it is like losing progress. Then hard difficulties also make fake version of the item when looking up, up in reality they are just random object "another key shaped rock" 
Difficulty of the game could be what item you lost
Hardest, house key. Small, cannot leave until you find it
Easiest, part of your key chain with no keys on it. You just like the items on it. (edited)

I like the difficulty idea, but like i also feel like that implies a replayability that's just not there

Feels more like a "one and done" experience

One of those games that's more about the atmosphere, experience, and art than being a "Game"

Agreed. atmospheric horror is one of those things that I think have great potential for games that are less mechanic focused and more "I am going to make you feel something, today is fear"
